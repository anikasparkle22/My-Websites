toxins website: I finished parts 1,2,3,4, and half of part 6.
Generated hexagons for each toxin, with a color that is representative of their safety level (averaged the simulated amounts and subtracted that from safety, then divided by the safety level and used the value to multiply to 53, which is my initial green value)
opacity relative to 700 g/mol, opacity = 100% if above 700 g/mol
the displays window can be changed
the display works on night mode though it does not automatically change to nightmode every night
part 5 is incomplete, the program crashes when I try to input links for every toxin, so I did not finish that part

To make this work when you pull this, download docker desktop if you do not already have, and reopen it in a container. Contact at665@cornell.edu for any questions
