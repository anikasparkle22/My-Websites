first time using php with css. most of the work done was done on this file.
The original green value is rgb(53,206,66,1) and I toggled the first value 53, to make a green-yellow range and the last value 1, the opacity to display weight in relation to 700 g/mol. if it was >700 g/mol, then the value would be 1 otherwise a fraction, making the hexagon lighter.
