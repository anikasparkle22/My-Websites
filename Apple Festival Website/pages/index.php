        <p>What better way to kick off New York Cider Week than with three days celebrating apple growers, cider makers, and of course cider donuts in Downtown Ithaca, New York.

        Apple Harvest Festival will host plenty of farmstand fresh apples and produce, delectable apple and seasonal baked goods, a variety of food trucks offering tasty bites, and a craft fair with artisans from around the region. There will also be live music and entertainment, plus a cider trail to enjoy refreshing cider in store and plenty of great apple and apples-inspired products for sale inside shops in and around Downtown.</p>
